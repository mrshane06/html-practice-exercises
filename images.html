            <p>I am normally a smiley person , but to me i find this emoji more of a smile ,
                but with a bit of hidden anger behind it. Like you are just putting up a smile with a taste of annoyance.

            <p>I really like staying at home , relaxing watching anime and eating , cause that is really calming for me and is really peaceful for me.
                This is one of my favourite things to do cause it allows me to rest my body and mind and lets me get away from real life problems and allows me to enter 
                another world.
